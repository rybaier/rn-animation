# RN advanced concepts course with Stephen Grider

This is my code from following the React Native Advanced concepts course on Udemy. 
- The first project is making an app similiar to Tinder
    - currently working on animation, since the course is a little outdated it has been fun trying figure out how to do it with the most current version of React Native.
